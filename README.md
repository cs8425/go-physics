# [WIP] go-physics

## Still Work In Progress!

### Lightweight 3D physics port from cannon.js
Inspired by [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js), and driven by the fact that the web lacks a physics engine, here comes cannon.js.
The rigid body physics engine includes simple collision detection, various body shapes, contacts, friction and constraints.
